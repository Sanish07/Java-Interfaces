# Java-Interfaces
Demonstrates the usage of Interfaces and its principles.
This repository includes the implementation of : 
- Interfaces : <em> - We use interfaces to build loosely coupled, extensible and testable applications. They are similar to class but only include method declaration and no implementation. </em> 
- Interface methods : <em> Methods declared inside interfaces are by default public and abstract. We can't declare them static or final. </em>
- Interface states : <em> Variables declared inside interfaces are by default public, static and final. </em>
- To have intefaces in action we make use of dependency injection.(Subtypes : Constructor, Setter and Method Injection respt.)
